# Nairaland Plus
We have all learnt to live with [Nairaland's](https://www.nairaland.com) never-changing UI. Nairaland Plus gives you an alternative. All you have to do is [install](#how-to-install) and browse Nairaland like you normally would.

## How It Looks Now

## Disclaimer
I'm just messing around hereðŸ˜…. I thought this would be fun to build (after seeing this [tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/Ui_uxdesigner/status/1264463867087925248)), so I'm building it. It's in no way affiliated with Nairaland.
